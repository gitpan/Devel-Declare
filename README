NAME
    Devel::Declare -

SYNOPSIS
    Look at the tests. This module is currently on CPAN to ease smoke
    testing and allow early adopters who've been involved in the design to
    experiment with it.

DESCRIPTION
  import
      use Devel::Declare qw(list of subs);

    Calls Devel::Declare->setup_for(__PACKAGE__ => \@list_of_subs);

  unimport
      no Devel::Declare;

    Calls Devel::Declare->teardown_for(__PACKAGE__);

  setup_for
      Devel::Declare->setup_for($package => \@subnames);

    Installs declarator magic (unless already installed) and registers
    "${package}::$name" for each member of @subnames

  teardown_for
      Devel::Declare->teardown_for($package);

    Deregisters all subs currently registered for $package and uninstalls
    declarator magic if number of teardown_for calls matches number of
    setup_for calls.
